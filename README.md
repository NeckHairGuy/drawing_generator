## digital drawings and organic pattern

Mutations is a series of digital hand drawings that were created from randomized algorithms with the aim of generating an organic way for the creationg of colorful and formless images. The results were drawn by hand in a digital surface which were distorted by random inputs from a specficly adapted algorithm that adds an organic and natural form into the image. Even of its abstract and cold digital parts, mutations aims to recreate an livid piece of nature. The images reflect the simplicity of colours and forms that create harmonic relation between digitalization and nature.
